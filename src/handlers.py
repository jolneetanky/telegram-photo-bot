This function handles the upload of media to GDrive.
1. Based on the chat type (private/public), the corresponding GDrive root folder is set as the root for all uploads.
2. Extract folder components from arguments.
3. Creates these folders in GDrive (if they don't yet exist).
4. Gets a list of all media files to upload, from the telegram message.
5. For each MediaFile in the list,
    1. Download these files onto the server.
    2. Upload to GDrive, into the leaf folder.
6. Delete the files that were downloaded onto the server. This cleanup happens whether the above ran successfully, and also runs in case of exceptions.

    *Welcome to tele/_photo/_bot!*

    You can use me to upload photos (and videosâ€¦ but that's a WIP) to Google Drive.

    *TO START:*
    `/set_link <link>`:
    - *sets the Google Drive folder link you'd like to upload your photos to*. 
    - Subsequent uploads in this chat will be made to the specified folder. Applies to group chats too.

    *UPLOADING A PHOTO/ALBUM*
    1. To upload a photo/album, simply *send your photos here in the chat.*
    2. Next, *reply to the album/photo you want to upload*, and send the command: `/upload`. This will simply upload the files into the folder link you set in `set_link`.
    3. If you want to specify default folders *within the folder you set*, refer below.
    
    *SPECIFYING DEFAULT FOLDER PATHS*
    (*NOTE:* In these examples, `root` refers to the root folder, ie. the one we set using `/set_link`.)
    1. *For nested paths*, just add a spacing in between each path. 
        (Eg. `/upload folder1 folder2` -> `root/folder1/folder2`
    2. *For folder names with spacing*, simply wrap the name in double quotes. 
        (Eg. `/upload "spacing 1" nospacing "spacing 2"` -> `root/"spacing 1"/nospacing/"spacing 2").
